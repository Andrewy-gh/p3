User: Create a workout for me please.

AI: I can definitely help with that! To create the perfect workout, I need a little more information:

    What's your fitness level (beginner, intermediate, or advanced)?
    What's your primary goal (strength, hypertrophy, endurance, power, or general fitness)?
    What equipment do you have available?
    How much time do you have for your workout session?
    What area would you like to focus on (push, pull, legs, full body, etc.)?
    Where will you be working out (home, gym, hotel, etc.)?

User: Intermediate. Strength. Barbells, dumbbells, cables. 1 hour. Push workout focusing on chest and shoulders. Gym.

AI: Perfect! Just one more quick question:

    Do you have any injuries or areas I should be aware of?

User: No injuries.

AI: Awesome, I'm generating your workout plan now! Here is your intermediate strength workout focusing on chest and shoulders! The workout includes barbell bench press, overhead press, incline dumbbell press, dumbbell lateral raises, and cable flyes. Be sure to warm up before each exercise and adjust the weight as needed to maintain proper form. Rest for 120-180 seconds between working sets.
