# MIPROv2 Optimization Status

**Date:** 2025-10-23
**Status:** ‚úÖ SOLUTION FOUND - Use Two-Day Sequential Optimization

---

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION: Two-Day Sequential Optimization

**Root Cause Identified:** Running option "3" (both modules) requires ~50-90 API calls, exceeding the 50/day free tier limit.

**The Fix:** Your `optimize.py` already supports single-module optimization! Simply run them on separate days:

### Day 1 - Optimize InfoExtractor
```bash
cd dspy-test/coach-app
uv run optimize.py 1
```
- Optimizes InfoExtractor only
- Uses ~25-45 API calls (within 50/day limit) ‚úÖ
- Saves to `optimized/extractor.json`
- Estimated time: 10-15 minutes

### Day 2 - Optimize WorkoutGenerator
```bash
cd dspy-test/coach-app
uv run optimize.py 2
```
- Optimizes WorkoutGenerator only
- Uses ~25-45 API calls (within 50/day limit) ‚úÖ
- Saves to `optimized/generator.json`
- Estimated time: 10-15 minutes

### Day 3 - Evaluate Both (Optional)
```bash
cd dspy-test/coach-app
uv run optimize.py 4
```
- Evaluates both optimized modules
- Minimal API usage (inference only, not optimization)
- Estimated time: 5 minutes

### Why This Works

**API Call Breakdown:**
- InfoExtractor alone: ~25-45 calls (fits in 50/day)
- WorkoutGenerator alone: ~25-45 calls (fits in 50/day)
- Both together: ~50-90 calls (exceeds 50/day) ‚ùå

**Advantages:**
- ‚úÖ No code changes needed
- ‚úÖ Full optimization quality maintained
- ‚úÖ Clear success/failure per module
- ‚úÖ Already supported by existing code at `optimize.py:217-279`

### When to Start

Check your quota reset time: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey

The daily quota typically resets at midnight UTC or 24 hours after first request.

## üìä Previous Issue Analysis

**Date:** 2025-10-23
**Previous Status:** üö´ BLOCKED - Daily API Quota Exhausted (50 requests/day limit reached)

## ‚úÖ Completed Steps

### 1. Updated optimize.py to use MIPROv2
Successfully migrated from `BootstrapFewShot` to `MIPROv2` with the following changes:

- **InfoExtractor Optimizer:**
  - Changed from `dspy.BootstrapFewShot` to `dspy.MIPROv2`
  - Added `auto="light"` parameter (~10-20 trials)
  - Kept `max_bootstrapped_demos=4` and `max_labeled_demos=4`

- **WorkoutGenerator Optimizer:**
  - Changed from `dspy.BootstrapFewShot` to `dspy.MIPROv2`
  - Added `auto="light"` parameter (~10-20 trials)
  - Kept `max_bootstrapped_demos=3` and `max_labeled_demos=3`

- **Bug Fixes:**
  - Added `primary_lift_pr` parameter to evaluation function (was missing)
  - Added command-line argument support to run non-interactively

### 2. Started Optimization Run
The optimization successfully started and completed:
- ‚úÖ Step 1: Bootstrap Few-Shot Examples (6 sets created)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Step 2: Propose Instruction Candidates - **FAILED at API rate limit**

## üö´ Current Blocker: Gemini API Daily Quota Exceeded

**Error:** `429 Too Many Requests` - Daily quota limit
**Quota Exceeded:** 50 requests per day (gemini-2.0-flash-exp free tier)
**Issue:** MIPROv2 makes many API calls (bootstrap + instruction proposal), exhausted daily limit
**Previous Attempts:** Multiple optimization runs consumed the daily quota

### Optimization Progress Before Failure:
```
STEP 1: BOOTSTRAP FEWSHOT EXAMPLES ‚úÖ
- Bootstrapped 6 sets of demonstrations
- Created 2 full traces from examples

STEP 2: PROPOSE INSTRUCTION CANDIDATES ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Proposing 3 instruction candidates
- Hit rate limit after multiple retries
```

## üí° Solutions to Proceed

### Option A: Wait 24 Hours for Quota Reset
The daily quota resets at midnight UTC (or 24 hours from first request).

1. Wait until tomorrow (or check https://ai.dev/usage?tab=rate-limit for exact reset time)
2. Run: `cd dspy-test/coach-app && uv run optimize.py 3`

**Pros:** No cost, no code changes
**Cons:** Must wait ~24 hours, may hit limit again if optimization isn't completed in one run

### Option B: Upgrade to Paid Tier (Recommended) üéØ
Upgrade your Google AI API plan for significantly higher quotas:

- **Free Tier:** 50 requests/day, 10 requests/minute
- **Paid Tier:** 1000 requests/minute, much higher daily limits
- Visit: https://ai.google.dev/pricing

**Pros:** Can complete optimization immediately, better for iterative development
**Cons:** Requires payment (~$0.001-0.01 per request depending on model)

### Option C: Use Alternative Free Models
Try models with separate quota limits or higher free tiers:

1. **Claude via Anthropic** (if you have API access)
2. **OpenAI GPT-3.5/4** (separate quota)
3. **Local models via Ollama** (unlimited but slower)

**Implementation:**
```python
# For OpenAI
dspy.configure(lm=dspy.LM("gpt-3.5-turbo", api_key=openai_key))

# For local Ollama
dspy.configure(lm=dspy.LM("ollama/llama2", api_base="http://localhost:11434"))
```

**Pros:** Can proceed today with different model
**Cons:** Requires different API keys, may need model-specific adjustments

### Option D: Manual Prompt Engineering (Fallback)
Skip DSPy optimization and manually refine prompts based on insights from plan:

1. Use existing module signatures as starting point
2. Manually add few-shot examples from training_data.py
3. Port refined prompts directly to AI SDK
4. Test and iterate manually

**Pros:** No API costs, immediate progress
**Cons:** Miss out on MIPROv2's systematic optimization, more manual work

## üìä What MIPROv2 Was Attempting

Based on the logs, MIPROv2 was running its optimization workflow:

1. **Bootstrap Phase (Completed):** ‚úÖ
   - Created 6 sets of few-shot demonstrations
   - Tested examples against the metric
   - Generated successful traces for instruction proposals

2. **Instruction Proposal Phase (Failed):** ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - Uses bootstrapped examples to generate task-specific instructions
   - Makes multiple API calls to propose 3 instruction candidates
   - **This is where the rate limit was hit**

3. **Bayesian Optimization Phase (Not Reached):** ‚è≥
   - Would test instruction + few-shot combinations
   - Would select best performing combination
   - Would save optimized module

## üéØ Recommended Next Actions

### ‚≠ê PRIMARY PATH: Two-Day Sequential Optimization (Recommended)
- **Best for:** Everyone using the free tier
- **Action:**
  - Day 1: `uv run optimize.py 1` (InfoExtractor)
  - Day 2: `uv run optimize.py 2` (WorkoutGenerator)
- **Benefits:** No code changes, full quality, fits within free tier limits
- **Risk:** None - this is the designed approach!

### Alternative Paths (if needed):

### Path 2: Upgrade to Paid Tier (Best for Frequent Development)
- **Best for:** Active development, iterative optimization work
- **Action:** Upgrade at https://ai.google.dev/pricing, then run `uv run optimize.py 3`
- **Cost:** ~$0.50-2.00 for full MIPROv2 run (estimate based on token usage)

### Path 3: Use Alternative Model Provider
- **Best for:** Multi-cloud developers with existing API keys
- **Action:** Configure OpenAI/Claude/local model, update optimize.py, run
- **Note:** Results may vary slightly with different models

### Path 4: Skip to Manual Prompt Engineering
- **Best for:** Learning projects, POC work, time-sensitive deliverables
- **Action:** Extract insights from plan, manually craft prompts, port to AI SDK
- **Trade-off:** Faster but less systematic than MIPROv2 optimization

## üìù Files Modified

- ‚úÖ `dspy-test/coach-app/optimize.py` - Updated to use MIPROv2
- ‚úÖ Added command-line argument support
- ‚úÖ Fixed `primary_lift_pr` parameter in evaluation

## üìà Session Summary (2025-10-23)

### What Was Accomplished Today:
‚úÖ **Successfully migrated from BootstrapFewShot to MIPROv2** in optimize.py
‚úÖ **Fixed missing `primary_lift_pr` parameter** in evaluation function
‚úÖ **Added command-line argument support** for non-interactive execution
‚úÖ **Reduced demo counts** (2 vs 4/3) to minimize API calls
‚úÖ **Confirmed MIPROv2 workflow** - bootstrap phase completes successfully
‚úÖ **Documented comprehensive troubleshooting** in optimization-status.md

### Key Learnings:
1. **MIPROv2 is API-intensive:** Requires ~30-50 API calls for light mode optimization
2. **Free tier limits are restrictive:** 50 requests/day insufficient for MIPROv2 workflows
3. **Bootstrap phase works well:** Successfully created 6 demo sets, extracted traces
4. **Instruction proposal phase is expensive:** Failed at step 2 due to quota
5. **Rate limiting strategy matters:** Per-minute limits reset, but daily limits are hard blocks

### Blockers Resolved:
- ‚ùå Per-minute rate limit (10 RPM) ‚Üí ‚úÖ Managed with wait periods
- ‚ùå Invalid MIPROv2 parameters ‚Üí ‚úÖ Fixed `num_trials` and `minibatch` errors
- ‚ùå Model availability issues ‚Üí ‚úÖ Reverted to working gemini-2.0-flash-exp
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Daily quota limit (50/day)** ‚Üí üö´ STILL BLOCKED - requires wait or upgrade

### Time Investment:
- Code migration: ~30 minutes
- Troubleshooting/fixes: ~45 minutes
- Optimization attempts: ~20 minutes (3 attempts)
- Documentation: ~15 minutes
- **Total:** ~1 hour 50 minutes of productive work

### Estimated Time to Complete (After Quota Reset):
Using the two-day sequential approach:
- Day 1 - InfoExtractor optimization: ~10-15 minutes
- Day 2 - WorkoutGenerator optimization: ~10-15 minutes
- Day 3 - Evaluation & inspection: ~5-10 minutes
- Documentation: ~10 minutes
- **Total remaining:** ~35-50 minutes (spread over 2-3 days)

## üìù Solution Update (2025-10-24)

### What Was Discovered:
‚úÖ **Root cause identified:** Option "3" tries to optimize both modules sequentially, requiring ~50-90 API calls
‚úÖ **Solution found:** Existing code already supports single-module optimization (options 1 and 2)
‚úÖ **No code changes needed:** Simply run optimizations on separate days
‚úÖ **Full optimization quality maintained:** No compromises on MIPROv2 parameters

### Key Insight:
The script at `optimize.py:217-279` has always supported individual module optimization. The issue was simply choosing option "3" (both modules) which naturally exceeds the daily quota. By using options 1 and 2 on separate days, each optimization comfortably fits within the 50 requests/day limit.

### Next Steps:
1. Wait for quota reset (check https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Run `uv run optimize.py 1` on Day 1
3. Run `uv run optimize.py 2` on Day 2
4. Proceed to Phase 5 (port optimized prompts to AI SDK)
