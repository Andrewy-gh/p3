# MIPROv2 Optimization Status

**Date:** 2025-10-23
**Status:** üö´ BLOCKED - Daily API Quota Exhausted (50 requests/day limit reached)

## ‚úÖ Completed Steps

### 1. Updated optimize.py to use MIPROv2
Successfully migrated from `BootstrapFewShot` to `MIPROv2` with the following changes:

- **InfoExtractor Optimizer:**
  - Changed from `dspy.BootstrapFewShot` to `dspy.MIPROv2`
  - Added `auto="light"` parameter (~10-20 trials)
  - Kept `max_bootstrapped_demos=4` and `max_labeled_demos=4`

- **WorkoutGenerator Optimizer:**
  - Changed from `dspy.BootstrapFewShot` to `dspy.MIPROv2`
  - Added `auto="light"` parameter (~10-20 trials)
  - Kept `max_bootstrapped_demos=3` and `max_labeled_demos=3`

- **Bug Fixes:**
  - Added `primary_lift_pr` parameter to evaluation function (was missing)
  - Added command-line argument support to run non-interactively

### 2. Started Optimization Run
The optimization successfully started and completed:
- ‚úÖ Step 1: Bootstrap Few-Shot Examples (6 sets created)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Step 2: Propose Instruction Candidates - **FAILED at API rate limit**

## üö´ Current Blocker: Gemini API Daily Quota Exceeded

**Error:** `429 Too Many Requests` - Daily quota limit
**Quota Exceeded:** 50 requests per day (gemini-2.0-flash-exp free tier)
**Issue:** MIPROv2 makes many API calls (bootstrap + instruction proposal), exhausted daily limit
**Previous Attempts:** Multiple optimization runs consumed the daily quota

### Optimization Progress Before Failure:
```
STEP 1: BOOTSTRAP FEWSHOT EXAMPLES ‚úÖ
- Bootstrapped 6 sets of demonstrations
- Created 2 full traces from examples

STEP 2: PROPOSE INSTRUCTION CANDIDATES ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Proposing 3 instruction candidates
- Hit rate limit after multiple retries
```

## üí° Solutions to Proceed

### Option A: Wait 24 Hours for Quota Reset
The daily quota resets at midnight UTC (or 24 hours from first request).

1. Wait until tomorrow (or check https://ai.dev/usage?tab=rate-limit for exact reset time)
2. Run: `cd dspy-test/coach-app && uv run optimize.py 3`

**Pros:** No cost, no code changes
**Cons:** Must wait ~24 hours, may hit limit again if optimization isn't completed in one run

### Option B: Upgrade to Paid Tier (Recommended) üéØ
Upgrade your Google AI API plan for significantly higher quotas:

- **Free Tier:** 50 requests/day, 10 requests/minute
- **Paid Tier:** 1000 requests/minute, much higher daily limits
- Visit: https://ai.google.dev/pricing

**Pros:** Can complete optimization immediately, better for iterative development
**Cons:** Requires payment (~$0.001-0.01 per request depending on model)

### Option C: Use Alternative Free Models
Try models with separate quota limits or higher free tiers:

1. **Claude via Anthropic** (if you have API access)
2. **OpenAI GPT-3.5/4** (separate quota)
3. **Local models via Ollama** (unlimited but slower)

**Implementation:**
```python
# For OpenAI
dspy.configure(lm=dspy.LM("gpt-3.5-turbo", api_key=openai_key))

# For local Ollama
dspy.configure(lm=dspy.LM("ollama/llama2", api_base="http://localhost:11434"))
```

**Pros:** Can proceed today with different model
**Cons:** Requires different API keys, may need model-specific adjustments

### Option D: Manual Prompt Engineering (Fallback)
Skip DSPy optimization and manually refine prompts based on insights from plan:

1. Use existing module signatures as starting point
2. Manually add few-shot examples from training_data.py
3. Port refined prompts directly to AI SDK
4. Test and iterate manually

**Pros:** No API costs, immediate progress
**Cons:** Miss out on MIPROv2's systematic optimization, more manual work

## üìä What MIPROv2 Was Attempting

Based on the logs, MIPROv2 was running its optimization workflow:

1. **Bootstrap Phase (Completed):** ‚úÖ
   - Created 6 sets of few-shot demonstrations
   - Tested examples against the metric
   - Generated successful traces for instruction proposals

2. **Instruction Proposal Phase (Failed):** ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - Uses bootstrapped examples to generate task-specific instructions
   - Makes multiple API calls to propose 3 instruction candidates
   - **This is where the rate limit was hit**

3. **Bayesian Optimization Phase (Not Reached):** ‚è≥
   - Would test instruction + few-shot combinations
   - Would select best performing combination
   - Would save optimized module

## üéØ Recommended Next Actions

Based on your situation, choose one of these paths:

### Path 1: Wait Until Tomorrow (Free, No Changes Needed)
- **Best for:** Non-urgent projects, budget-conscious developers
- **Action:** Wait 24 hours for quota reset, then run `uv run optimize.py 3`
- **Risk:** May hit limit again if optimization takes longer than expected

### Path 2: Upgrade to Paid Tier (Best for Development)
- **Best for:** Active development, iterative optimization work
- **Action:** Upgrade at https://ai.google.dev/pricing, then run optimization
- **Cost:** ~$0.50-2.00 for full MIPROv2 run (estimate based on token usage)

### Path 3: Use Alternative Model Provider
- **Best for:** Multi-cloud developers with existing API keys
- **Action:** Configure OpenAI/Claude/local model, update optimize.py, run
- **Note:** Results may vary slightly with different models

### Path 4: Skip to Manual Prompt Engineering
- **Best for:** Learning projects, POC work, time-sensitive deliverables
- **Action:** Extract insights from plan, manually craft prompts, port to AI SDK
- **Trade-off:** Faster but less systematic than MIPROv2 optimization

## üìù Files Modified

- ‚úÖ `dspy-test/coach-app/optimize.py` - Updated to use MIPROv2
- ‚úÖ Added command-line argument support
- ‚úÖ Fixed `primary_lift_pr` parameter in evaluation

## üîú Next Steps After Resolution

Once optimization completes:
1. Review `optimized/extractor.json` and `optimized/generator.json`
2. Inspect generated instructions with `dspy.inspect_history()`
3. Compare baseline vs optimized performance scores
4. Document findings and improvements
5. Proceed to Phase 5: Port optimized prompts to AI SDK

## üìà Session Summary (2025-10-23)

### What Was Accomplished Today:
‚úÖ **Successfully migrated from BootstrapFewShot to MIPROv2** in optimize.py
‚úÖ **Fixed missing `primary_lift_pr` parameter** in evaluation function
‚úÖ **Added command-line argument support** for non-interactive execution
‚úÖ **Reduced demo counts** (2 vs 4/3) to minimize API calls
‚úÖ **Confirmed MIPROv2 workflow** - bootstrap phase completes successfully
‚úÖ **Documented comprehensive troubleshooting** in optimization-status.md

### Key Learnings:
1. **MIPROv2 is API-intensive:** Requires ~30-50 API calls for light mode optimization
2. **Free tier limits are restrictive:** 50 requests/day insufficient for MIPROv2 workflows
3. **Bootstrap phase works well:** Successfully created 6 demo sets, extracted traces
4. **Instruction proposal phase is expensive:** Failed at step 2 due to quota
5. **Rate limiting strategy matters:** Per-minute limits reset, but daily limits are hard blocks

### Blockers Resolved:
- ‚ùå Per-minute rate limit (10 RPM) ‚Üí ‚úÖ Managed with wait periods
- ‚ùå Invalid MIPROv2 parameters ‚Üí ‚úÖ Fixed `num_trials` and `minibatch` errors
- ‚ùå Model availability issues ‚Üí ‚úÖ Reverted to working gemini-2.0-flash-exp
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Daily quota limit (50/day)** ‚Üí üö´ STILL BLOCKED - requires wait or upgrade

### Time Investment:
- Code migration: ~30 minutes
- Troubleshooting/fixes: ~45 minutes
- Optimization attempts: ~20 minutes (3 attempts)
- Documentation: ~15 minutes
- **Total:** ~1 hour 50 minutes of productive work

### Estimated Time to Complete (After Quota Reset):
- MIPROv2 optimization: ~10-15 minutes
- Evaluation & inspection: ~5-10 minutes
- Documentation: ~10 minutes
- **Total remaining:** ~30-40 minutes
