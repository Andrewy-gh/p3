# MIPROv2 Optimization Status

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-29
**Status:** ✅ EVALUATION COMPLETE - Ready for Production Integration

## Summary

Optimization and evaluation completed successfully:
- **InfoExtractor**: 17.14% improvement (62.86% → 80.00%)
- **WorkoutGenerator**: Already optimal at 92.50%
- **Action Required**: Port optimized prompts to production (`backend/src/prompts.ts`)

---

## Current Status

### ✅ Completed

#### 1. Module Optimization (2025-10-27)
- **InfoExtractor optimization**
  - Output: `optimized/extractor.json`
  - Contains: Optimized instructions + 2 few-shot examples

- **WorkoutGenerator optimization**
  - Output: `optimized/generator.json`
  - Contains: Optimized instructions

#### 2. Bug Fix - Evaluation Metric (2025-10-29)
- **Issue Found**: `workout_quality()` metric was looking for `prediction.workout_json` but WorkoutGenerator outputs `prediction.workout` (Pydantic object)
- **Fix Applied**: Updated `coach-app/metrics.py:68-104` to handle multiple output formats:
  - Pydantic models (`.model_dump()`)
  - Dictionary objects
  - JSON strings with markdown code fences
- **Files Modified**:
  - `coach-app/metrics.py` - Fixed field name handling
  - `coach-app/optimize.py` - Fixed Unicode encoding issues (checkmarks, delta symbols)

#### 3. Evaluation Results (2025-10-29)
**InfoExtractor Performance:**
- Original Score: 62.86%
- Optimized Score: 80.00%
- **Improvement: +17.14%** ✅

**WorkoutGenerator Performance:**
- Original Score: 92.50%
- Optimized Score: 92.50%
- **Improvement: +0.00%** (Already performing well, no change needed)

## Next Steps

### 1. Port Optimized Prompts to AI SDK (READY NOW)
Integrate optimized prompts into production:
- Review `optimized/extractor.json` for InfoExtractor improvements
- Review `optimized/generator.json` for WorkoutGenerator improvements
- Update `backend/src/prompts.ts` with optimized instructions
- Add few-shot examples from extractor.json

### 2. Production Testing
After porting prompts:
- Test InfoExtractor with real conversations
- Verify extraction accuracy improvements
- Monitor WorkoutGenerator quality (already at 92.5%)

---

## Key Findings

### InfoExtractor
- **Significant improvement** from optimization (+17.14%)
- Original prompt struggled with field extraction consistency
- Optimized version shows better understanding of conversation context
- Few-shot examples help guide structured output format

### WorkoutGenerator
- **Already high-performing** at 92.5% without optimization
- Generates valid JSON consistently
- Exercise selection appropriate for equipment/goal
- Rep ranges match training goals
- No optimization needed - current prompt is effective

### Metric Bug Discovery
- Initial evaluation showed WorkoutGenerator at 0% (misleading)
- Root cause: Field name mismatch between module output and metric
- After fix: Revealed true 92.5% baseline performance
- Lesson: Always validate metrics match actual module signatures

## Key Files

- `dspy-test/coach-app/optimize.py` - Optimization script with rate limiting
- `dspy-test/optimized/extractor.json` - Optimized InfoExtractor module
- `dspy-test/optimized/generator.json` - Optimized WorkoutGenerator module
- `backend/src/prompts.ts` - Production prompts (to be updated)

---

## Optimization Configuration

**MIPROv2 Settings:**
- `auto="light"` - ~10-20 trials per module
- `max_bootstrapped_demos=2` - Reduced for API efficiency
- `max_labeled_demos=2` - Reduced for API efficiency

**API Usage:**
- InfoExtractor: ~25-45 calls ✅
- WorkoutGenerator: ~25-45 calls ✅
- Total: ~50-90 calls (spread over time with rate limiting)

**Gemini Free Tier Limits:**
- 10 requests/minute (managed by RateLimitedLM)
- 50 requests/day

---

## Troubleshooting

### If evaluation shows 0% scores:
1. Check metric field names match module output signatures in `modules.py`
2. Verify metric can handle the output format (Pydantic, dict, JSON string)
3. Test metric directly with mock predictions

### If Unicode errors occur (Windows):
- Replace checkmarks (✓) with `[SUCCESS]`
- Replace delta symbols (Δ) with `Change:` in print statements
- Affects `optimize.py` print output only
