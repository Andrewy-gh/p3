# MIPROv2 Optimization Status

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-27
**Status:** ✅ OPTIMIZATION COMPLETE - Ready for Evaluation

---

## Current Status

### ✅ Completed
- **InfoExtractor optimization** - Completed on 2025-10-27
  - Output: `optimized/extractor.json`
  - Contains: Optimized instructions + 2 few-shot examples

- **WorkoutGenerator optimization** - Completed on 2025-10-27
  - Output: `optimized/generator.json`
  - Contains: Optimized instructions

- **Rate limiting fix** - Added `RateLimitedLM` wrapper to `optimize.py`
  - Enforces 9 requests/minute (under 10/min free tier limit)
  - Prevents 429 rate limit errors

---

## Next Steps

### 1. Evaluate Performance (Recommended Next Step)
```bash
cd dspy-test/coach-app
uv run optimize.py 4
```
- Compares original vs optimized module performance
- Shows improvement metrics
- Minimal API usage (~5-10 calls)

### 2. Port Optimized Prompts to AI SDK
After evaluation, integrate optimized prompts into production:
- Review `optimized/extractor.json` for InfoExtractor improvements
- Review `optimized/generator.json` for WorkoutGenerator improvements
- Update `backend/src/prompts.ts` with optimized instructions
- Add few-shot examples from extractor.json

---

## Key Files

- `dspy-test/coach-app/optimize.py` - Optimization script with rate limiting
- `dspy-test/optimized/extractor.json` - Optimized InfoExtractor module
- `dspy-test/optimized/generator.json` - Optimized WorkoutGenerator module
- `backend/src/prompts.ts` - Production prompts (to be updated)

---

## Optimization Configuration

**MIPROv2 Settings:**
- `auto="light"` - ~10-20 trials per module
- `max_bootstrapped_demos=2` - Reduced for API efficiency
- `max_labeled_demos=2` - Reduced for API efficiency

**API Usage:**
- InfoExtractor: ~25-45 calls ✅
- WorkoutGenerator: ~25-45 calls ✅
- Total: ~50-90 calls (spread over time with rate limiting)

**Gemini Free Tier Limits:**
- 10 requests/minute (managed by RateLimitedLM)
- 50 requests/day
