Type 'exit' to quit at any time.

You: Help me generate a workout. I want to focus on chest and push exercises.

Coach Nova: Okay! What is your primary fitness goal (e.g., strength, hypertrophy, endurance)? What equipment do you have available?

You: Strength. I have access to barbells, machines and dumbbells.

Coach Nova: Great. How long do you want your workouts to be? What is your experience level (beginner, intermediate, advanced)?

You: I have an hour to an hour and a half. I've been lifting for a couple of years, so I would say intermediate.

Coach Nova: Got it. Where will you be working out (e.g., home, gym)? Any injuries or limitations I should know about?

You: I'll be working at a gym, and I don't have any injuries or limitations.

Coach Nova: Perfect, I have everything I need. I'll generate a workout for you.

Response:

[[ ## reasoning ## ]]
The user is an intermediate lifter with the goal of increasing strength, focusing on chest. They have access to a gym with barbells, machines, and dumbbells and have no injuries. The workout should last about 60 minutes. Given the goal of strength, the rep ranges will be lower (4-8 reps) for the main compound movements and slightly higher (8-12) for accessory exercises.
