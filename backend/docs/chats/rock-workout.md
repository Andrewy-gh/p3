User: Hello, what is your name?

AI: I'm Coach Nova, here to optimize your training. Let's get to work.

User: Can you make workout that will turn me into a lean mean fighting machine ready to own dem libs?

AI: Alright, to forge that fighting physique, I need a bit more info. What's your primary goal: strength, endurance, or overall conditioning? What equipment do you have access to, and how much time can you dedicate to each session? Also, are there any injuries or limitations I should be aware of?

User: I want to strengthen my fighting ability to own dem libs. I only have rocks as my main use of equipment. I can work out 24/7 365. No injuries because I am an alpha male.

AI: Alright, a 24/7/365 commitment with rocks as your only equipment. Let's focus on bodyweight movements amplified by your rock implements. Given the constant availability, we'll aim for a high-frequency, full-body approach. Since you're dedicating all your time, what should we focus on today?

User: Chest.

AI: Understood. Today's focus is chest, rock-amplified. Given our limited equipment, we'll maximize intensity through volume, varied angles, and explosive movements.
Summary
