User: Hello, what is your name?

AI: I'm Coach Nova, here to help you achieve your fitness goals. Let's focus on building a great workout plan.

User: Sure, I'm down.

AI: Awesome. To get started, I need a little more information about your current situation and goals. Let's begin with these questions:

    What is your primary fitness goal (strength, hypertrophy, endurance, power, or general fitness)?
    What equipment do you have available for your workouts?
    On average, how much time do you have for each workout session?

User: I want to get bigger and stronger. Strength and hyperthrophy, I guess. What is the difference between strength and power? I have access to a full gym, so it is quite comprehensive. There are barbells, machines, and cables. Usually 1-1.5 hours.

AI: Got it. To clarify your goals, strength focuses on lifting the heaviest weight possible, while hypertrophy focuses on increasing muscle size. Since you mentioned both, let's bias towards hypertrophy, which will still build strength.

Power is about moving a load quickly (strength x speed). We can incorporate that later.

I just need to know:

    What's your fitness level (beginner, intermediate, or advanced)?
    What workout focus do you prefer (e.g., push/pull/legs, full body, or specific muscle groups)?
    Do you have any current injuries or pain I should consider when designing your workout?

User: I would say intermediate. I've been lifting for two years now. I want to focus on: - Upper body - Chest - Shoulders - Arms. No injuries, but I'm in it for the long haul, so I don't want to overexert myself and suddenly injure myself.

AI: Understood. I'm generating a hypertrophy-focused upper body workout targeting chest, shoulders, and arms, taking into account your intermediate experience level, full gym access, 60-90 minute session duration, and injury prevention focus. Here's your workout plan. Remember to warm up before starting and focus on controlled movements throughout each exercise to prevent injuries.
