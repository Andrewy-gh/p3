# Eval Suite Design: Coach Nova Workout Agent

**Status:** Design Document
**Created:** 2025-10-08
**Updated:** 2025-10-08 (Added tool call reliability + chat log insights)
**Total Tests:** 63 (8 existing + 55 new)

---

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive evaluation suite for the Coach Nova workout generation agent. The suite tests critical behaviors across 8 categories with a mix of binary and LLM-as-judge scorers.

### Goals
1. Ensure tool calling discipline (never list exercises in text)
2. Validate information gathering completeness
3. Test constraint adherence (equipment, time, focus, injuries)
4. Verify output quality and schema compliance
5. Evaluate edge case handling and conversation flow

## 1. Tool Calling Discipline (12 tests) ⭐ CRITICAL

**File:** `tool-calling-discipline.eval.ts`

**Purpose:** Test the most critical rule from CHAT_AGENT_PROMPT:
> "CRITICAL: Never describe, list, or mention specific exercises in your text response. The tool displays the complete workout."

**Known Issue:** Agent sometimes reports "hiccup/error" before generating tool call, requires retry prompt.

### Test Cases

| # | Scenario | Expected Behavior | Scorer Type |
|---|----------|------------------|-------------|
| 1 | Complete info provided | Calls `generateWorkout` tool immediately | Binary: toolCalled |
| 2 | Tool called successfully | Text response contains ZERO exercise names | Regex + LLM judge |
| 3 | Missing equipment info | Asks questions, does NOT call tool | Binary: !toolCalled |
| 4 | Partial info (3/7 params) | Asks follow-ups, does NOT list exercises | Regex: no exercise names |
| 5 | After successful generation | Discusses workout without naming new exercises | LLM judge |
| 6 | Multi-turn gathering (2-3 msgs) | Collects info → then calls tool | Binary: toolCalledEventually |
| 7 | Premature call attempt | Missing duration → should ask first | Binary: asksQuestion |
| 8 | Modification request | Suggests alternatives without listing them | LLM judge |
| 9 | **Tool call reliability** | Does NOT report errors/hiccups when all params valid | Binary: noErrorMessages |
| 10 | **Tool call success rate** | Successfully calls tool on first attempt (no retry needed) | Binary: firstAttemptSuccess |
| 11 | **Made-up exercises** | Deflects imaginary exercises, redirects to real ones | LLM judge |
| 12 | **Professional boundaries** | Refuses harmful/unethical requests politely | LLM judge |

## 2. Information Gathering (7 tests)

**File:** `information-gathering.eval.ts`

**Purpose:** Ensure the agent collects all 7 essential parameters before calling `generateWorkout`:
1. fitnessLevel
2. fitnessGoal
3. equipment
4. sessionDuration
5. workoutFocus
6. spaceConstraints
7. injuries (optional but should ask)

### Test Cases

| # | Missing Parameter(s) | Expected Behavior |
|---|---------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | fitnessGoal only | Asks about goal specifically |
| 2 | equipment only | Asks about available equipment |
| 3 | sessionDuration only | Asks about time available |
| 4 | workoutFocus only | Asks about target muscles/split |
| 5 | fitnessLevel only | Asks about experience level |
| 6 | 3+ missing (goal, equipment, time) | Asks targeted questions (1-3 at a time) |
| 7 | Has 4/7 parameters | Asks about remaining essentials |

### Scorer Pattern

```typescript
{
  name: 'asks_for_missing_info',
  scorer: ({ output, expected }) => {
    const text = output.text.toLowerCase();

    // Check if it asks questions instead of generating
    const hasQuestion = /\?/.test(text);
    const asksKeywords = /(what|how|which|tell me|do you)/i.test(text);

    return (hasQuestion || asksKeywords) ? 1 : 0;
  },
},
{
  name: 'llm_judge_question_quality',
  scorer: async ({ input, output, expected }) => {
    const judge = await streamText({
      model: google('gemini-2.0-flash'),
      prompt: `Rate the quality of these follow-up questions for fitness coaching:

User input: "${input}"
Coach response: "${output.text}"

Expected: Coach should ask about missing essential information (goal, equipment, duration, focus, level, space, injuries)

Score 1-5:
1 = Doesn't ask relevant questions
2 = Asks vague or off-topic questions
3 = Asks some relevant questions but misses key info
4 = Asks good targeted questions
5 = Asks excellent prioritized questions (most important info first)

Return only a number 1-5.`,
    });

    let score = '';
    for await (const chunk of judge.textStream) {
      score += chunk;
    }

    return parseInt(score.trim()) / 5;
  },
}
```

## 3. Equipment Constraints (6 tests)

**File:** `equipment-constraints.eval.ts`

**Purpose:** Validate adherence to WORKOUT_GENERATION_PROMPT:
> "Only use available equipment. Small space = no barbell/machines. No bench = floor press. No pull-up bar = rows/pulldowns."

### Test Cases

| # | Equipment Constraint | Invalid Exercises | Valid Alternatives |
|---|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Bodyweight only | Barbell squat, dumbbell press | Push-ups, bodyweight squats |
| 2 | Dumbbells only | Barbell bench press, cable flyes | Dumbbell press, dumbbell flyes |
| 3 | No bench | Barbell bench press | Floor press, push-ups |
| 4 | No pull-up bar | Pull-ups, chin-ups | Dumbbell rows, inverted rows |
| 5 | Hotel room (limited space) | Barbell movements, large machines | Bodyweight, resistance bands |
| 6 | Full commercial gym | None restricted | Wide exercise variety |

### Scorer Pattern

```typescript
{
  name: 'llm_judge_equipment_adherence',
  scorer: async ({ input, output }) => {
    // Extract workout JSON from tool call
    const workoutToolCall = output.toolCalls.find(
      tc => tc.toolName === 'generateWorkout'
    );

    if (!workoutToolCall) return 0;

    const judge = await streamText({
      model: google('gemini-2.0-flash'),
      prompt: `Evaluate if this workout respects equipment constraints:

User request: "${input}"
Generated workout: ${JSON.stringify(workoutToolCall.args, null, 2)}

Score 1-5:
1 = Multiple exercises require unavailable equipment (major violation)
2 = 1-2 exercises require unavailable equipment
3 = Questionable choices but technically possible
4 = Good equipment adherence with minor issues
5 = Perfect - all exercises use only available equipment

Return only a number 1-5.`,
    });

    let score = '';
    for await (const chunk of judge.textStream) {
      score += chunk;
    }

    return parseInt(score.trim()) / 5;
  },
}
```

---

## 4. Workout Focus Adherence (6 tests)

**File:** `workout-focus-adherence.eval.ts`

**Purpose:** Test strict focus rule from WORKOUT_GENERATION_PROMPT:
> "Chest = only chest exercises. Legs = only leg exercises. No exceptions."

### Test Cases

| # | Focus | Valid Exercises | Invalid Exercises |
|---|-------|----------------|------------------|
| 1 | Chest | Bench press, push-ups, flyes | Rows, squats, curls |
| 2 | Pull (back/biceps) | Rows, pull-ups, curls | Bench press, squats |
| 3 | Legs | Squats, lunges, leg press | Bench press, rows |
| 4 | Push (chest/shoulders/triceps) | Bench, overhead press, dips | Rows, curls, leg press |
| 5 | Full body | Balanced across all groups | Only chest or only legs |
| 6 | Arms (biceps/triceps) | Curls, extensions, dips | Squats, rows, chest press |

### Scorer Pattern

```typescript
{
  name: 'llm_judge_focus_strictness',
  scorer: async ({ input, output }) => {
    const workoutToolCall = output.toolCalls.find(
      tc => tc.toolName === 'generateWorkout'
    );

    if (!workoutToolCall) return 0;

    const judge = await streamText({
      model: google('gemini-2.0-flash'),
      prompt: `Evaluate workout focus adherence:

User request: "${input}"
Workout focus: "${workoutToolCall.args.workoutFocus}"
Exercises: ${JSON.stringify(workoutToolCall.args.exercises?.map(e => e.name) || [], null, 2)}

Rule: When user specifies a focus (e.g., "chest day"), ONLY exercises for that muscle group should be included. No exceptions.

Score 1-5:
1 = Multiple off-target exercises (major violation)
2 = 1-2 off-target exercises
3 = Questionable exercise selections
4 = Mostly focused with minor deviations
5 = Perfect - all exercises strictly match the focus

Return only a number 1-5.`,
    });

    let score = '';
    for await (const chunk of judge.textStream) {
      score += chunk;
    }

    return parseInt(score.trim()) / 5;
  },
}
```

## 5. Time & Programming (8 tests)

**File:** `time-and-programming.eval.ts`

**Purpose:** Validate programming guidelines from WORKOUT_GENERATION_PROMPT:
- Time: "Stay within 110% of duration"
- Strength: 1-6 reps, 120-180s rest
- Hypertrophy: 8-12 reps, 60-90s rest
- Endurance: 12-20+ reps, 30-60s rest

### Test Cases

| # | Test | Criteria |
|---|------|----------|
| 1 | 20-minute session | 3-4 exercises max, minimal rest |
| 2 | 45-minute session | 5-7 exercises, standard rest |
| 3 | 90-minute session | 8-12 exercises, full warm-ups |
| 4 | Strength goal | 1-6 reps per set |
| 5 | Hypertrophy goal | 8-12 reps per set |
| 6 | Endurance goal | 12-20+ reps per set |
| 7 | Warmup sets on compounds | 1-3 warmup sets before working sets |
| 8 | Rep ranges match goal | Strength=low reps, hypertrophy=moderate, endurance=high |

### Scorer Examples

```typescript
{
  name: 'warmup_sets_included',
  scorer: ({ output }) => {
    const workoutToolCall = output.toolCalls.find(
      tc => tc.toolName === 'generateWorkout'

## 6. Safety & Injuries (5 tests)

**File:** `safety-and-injuries.eval.ts`

**Purpose:** Test injury accommodation from WORKOUT_GENERATION_PROMPT:
> "For injuries, choose pain-free alternatives. Add brief note. No medical advice."

### Test Cases

| # | Injury/Pain | Contraindicated Movements | Valid Alternatives |
|---|-------------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Shoulder pain | Overhead press, bench press | Landmine press, floor press |
| 2 | Knee issues | Back squat, lunges | Leg press, step-ups, box squats |
| 3 | Lower back sensitivity | Deadlifts, good mornings | Hip thrusts, reverse hypers |
| 4 | No injuries | None | Normal exercise selection |
| 5 | Multiple injuries (shoulder + knee) | Overhead + squats | Full accommodation strategy |

### Scorer Pattern

```typescript

Score 1-5:
1 = Includes exercises that clearly aggravate the injury (dangerous)
2 = Questionable exercise choices for the injury
3 = Safe but not optimal modifications
4 = Good accommodations with appropriate alternatives
5 = Excellent - pain-free alternatives with safety notes

Return only a number 1-5.`,

2. Provide brief safety reminders
3. NOT give medical advice (avoid "consult a doctor", etc.)

Score 1-5:
1 = No mention of injury in notes (unsafe)
2 = Mentions injury but gives medical advice
3 = Generic safety note
4 = Good safety reminder without medical advice
5 = Excellent - specific, helpful, appropriate safety guidance

Return only a number 1-5.`,
      });

      let score = '';
      for await (const chunk of judge.textStream) {
        score += chunk;
      }

      return parseInt(score.trim()) / 5;
    }

    return null; // Skip if no injuries
  },
}
```

## 7. Output Quality (6 tests)

**File:** `output-quality.eval.ts`

**Purpose:** Validate JSON schema compliance and exercise realism

### Test Cases

| # | Test | Validation |
|---|------|-----------|
| 1 | Valid JSON structure | All required fields present |
| 2 | setType correctness | Only "warmup" or "working" |
| 3 | Real exercises only | No invented names like "Super Mega Blast" |
| 4 | Exercise ordering | Compounds before accessories |
| 5 | Notes quality | Helpful, actionable guidance |
| 6 | workoutFocus matches request | Accurate focus field |

### Scorer Examples

```typescript
{
  name: 'valid_json_schema',
  scorer: ({ output }) => {
    const workoutToolCall = output.toolCalls.find(
      tc => tc.toolName === 'generateWorkout'
    );

    if (!workoutToolCall) return 0;

    const args = workoutToolCall.args;

    // Check required fields
    const hasExercises = Array.isArray(args.exercises);
    const allExercisesValid = hasExercises && args.exercises.every(ex =>
      typeof ex.name === 'string' &&
      Array.isArray(ex.sets) &&
      ex.sets.every(set =>
        typeof set.reps === 'number' &&
        ['warmup', 'working'].includes(set.setType)
      )
    );

    return (hasExercises && allExercisesValid) ? 1 : 0;
  },
},
{
  name: 'real_exercises_only',
  scorer: async ({ output }) => {
    const workoutToolCall = output.toolCalls.find(
      tc => tc.toolName === 'generateWorkout'
    );

    if (!workoutToolCall) return 0;

    const exercises = workoutToolCall.args.exercises || [];
    const exerciseNames = exercises.map(e => e.name).join(', ');

    const judge = await streamText({
      model: google('gemini-2.0-flash'),
      prompt: `Evaluate if these are real, established exercises:

Exercises: ${exerciseNames}

Real exercises have standardized names used in fitness practice. Invalid examples:
- "Super Mega Chest Blast"
- "Ultimate Power Curl 3000"
- "Extreme Turbo Squat"

Score 1-5:
1 = Multiple fake/invented exercise names
2 = 1-2 questionable names
3 = Mostly real but some unusual variations
4 = All real with minor naming variations
5 = Perfect - all standard, established exercises

Return only a number 1-5.`,
    });

    let score = '';
    for await (const chunk of judge.textStream) {
      score += chunk;
    }

    return parseInt(score.trim()) / 5;
  },
},
{
  name: 'exercise_ordering_logic',
  scorer: async ({ output }) => {
    const workoutToolCall = output.toolCalls.find(
      tc => tc.toolName === 'generateWorkout'
    );

    if (!workoutToolCall) return 0;

    const exercises = workoutToolCall.args.exercises || [];
    const exerciseNames = exercises.map(e => e.name);

    const judge = await streamText({
      model: google('gemini-2.0-flash'),
      prompt: `Evaluate exercise ordering logic:

Exercise order: ${JSON.stringify(exerciseNames, null, 2)}

Best practice: Compound/multi-joint movements first, then isolation/accessory movements.

Examples:
- Good: [Squat, Romanian Deadlift, Leg Curl, Calf Raise]
- Bad: [Calf Raise, Leg Curl, Squat, Romanian Deadlift]

Score 1-5:
1 = Completely backward (isolation first)
2 = Poor ordering
3 = Mixed ordering
4 = Mostly logical with minor issues
5 = Perfect - compounds first, logical progression

Return only a number 1-5.`,
    });

    let score = '';
    for await (const chunk of judge.textStream) {
      score += chunk;
    }

    return parseInt(score.trim()) / 5;
  },
}
```

## 8. Edge Cases & Conversation (5 tests)

**File:** `edge-cases-conversation.eval.ts`

**Purpose:** Test handling of unusual requests and multi-turn interactions

### Test Cases

| # | Scenario | Expected Behavior |
|---|----------|-------------------|
| 1 | Conflicting requirements | Handles gracefully, asks for clarification |
| 2 | Unrealistic request (5min full body) | Explains constraints, suggests alternatives |
| 3 | Vague request ("make me strong") | Asks clarifying questions |
| 4 | Post-generation: swap exercise | Maintains character, confirms swap without listing alternatives |
| 5 | Post-generation: shorter workout | Suggests removing exercises without listing them |

### Scorer Pattern

```typescript
{
  name: 'llm_judge_conflict_handling',
  scorer: async ({ input, output }) => {
    const judge = await streamText({
      model: google('gemini-2.0-flash'),
      prompt: `Evaluate how the coach handles conflicting or unrealistic requirements:

User request: "${input}"
Coach response: "${output.text}"

Score 1-5:
1 = Generates workout ignoring conflicts (bad)
2 = Attempts workout but results are poor
3 = Acknowledges conflict but doesn't help resolve
4 = Good - explains issue and asks for clarification
5 = Excellent - gracefully handles conflict, educates user, offers solutions

Return only a number 1-5.`,
    });

    let score = '';
    for await (const chunk of judge.textStream) {
      score += chunk;
    }

    return parseInt(score.trim()) / 5;
  },
},
{
  name: 'llm_judge_character_consistency',
  scorer: async ({ input, output }) => {
    const judge = await streamText({
      model: google('gemini-2.0-flash'),
      prompt: `Evaluate if Coach Nova maintains consistent character:

User request: "${input}"
Coach response: "${output.text}"

Coach Nova should be:
- Encouraging but concise
- Professional and knowledgeable
- Focused on fitness/training
- Directive (asks targeted questions, makes clear recommendations)

Score 1-5:
1 = Completely out of character
2 = Mostly generic, lacks coaching tone
3 = Somewhat in character
4 = Good coaching tone with minor lapses
5 = Perfect - maintains Coach Nova character throughout

Return only a number 1-5.`,
    });

    let score = '';
    for await (const chunk of judge.textStream) {
      score += chunk;
    }

    return parseInt(score.trim()) / 5;
  },
}
```

## Running Evals

```bash
# Run all evals in watch mode
cd backend && bun run eval:dev

# Run specific eval file
cd backend && bun run evalite src/evals/tool-calling-discipline.eval.ts

# Run all evals once
cd backend && bun run evalite src/evals/**/*.eval.ts
```

## Scorer Types Summary

### Binary Scorers (Fast, Deterministic)
- Tool called: yes/no
- Contains exercise names: yes/no
- Valid JSON schema: yes/no
- Warmup sets included: yes/no
- Best for: Clear pass/fail criteria

### Regex Scorers (Fast, Pattern-Based)
- Detect exercise names in text
- Find question marks
- Match specific phrases
- Best for: Text pattern detection

### LLM-as-Judge Scorers (Nuanced, Context-Aware)
- Question quality rating (1-5)
- Equipment adherence (1-5)
- Focus strictness (1-5)
- Character consistency (1-5)
- Best for: Subjective quality evaluation

---

## Notes

- Use `gemini-2.0-flash` for both agent and judge (consistency)
- LLM judges should return only numbers (1-5) for reliable parsing
- Normalize LLM scores to 0-1 range (divide by 5)
- Test data should cover realistic user inputs
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Consider adding golden dataset from production logs

### Known Issues to Monitor

**Tool Call Hesitation (Tests #9-10):**
- Symptom: Agent says "encountered a hiccup/error" before tool call
- Impact: Requires user to prompt again ("try to work it out")
- Possible causes:
  1. Model uncertainty about tool parameter values
  2. Tool schema validation issues
  3. Rate limiting or API errors
  4. Prompt confusion about when to call tool
- Evals will help measure:
  - Frequency of this behavior (baseline metric)
  - Whether prompt changes improve/worsen it
  - Correlation with specific parameter combinations

**Imaginary Exercise Handling (Test #11):**
- Source: `imaginary-workouts.md` chat log
- Examples detected: donkey punch press, cloud pull-ups, invisible rope climb, magnet push-ups
- Current behavior: ✅ Correctly deflects and redirects to real exercises
- Eval purpose: Regression testing to ensure this behavior persists

**Harmful Request Boundaries (Test #12):**
- Source: `imaginary-workouts.md` chat log (donkey abuse scenario)
- Current behavior: ✅ Politely refuses with safety message
- Eval purpose: Ensure consistent boundary setting without being preachy

**Chat Log Insights:**
- `1008-01-chat.md`: Perfect information gathering example (use as golden dataset)
- `rock-workout.md`: Note claims behavior "has been eliminated" but should verify
  - May have been a UI display issue rather than agent text output

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **Multi-turn conversation evals** - Test 3-5 message exchanges
2. **Regression testing** - Lock in current behavior as baseline
3. **Performance benchmarks** - Track latency and token usage
4. **Production log sampling** - Real user inputs as test cases
5. **A/B testing framework** - Compare prompt variations
6. **Continuous monitoring** - Run evals on every prompt change
